## Programming with JavaScript ##

- JavaSript allow webpages to be more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while being viewed in browser .

-Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:
1. **Access** the content of the page
2. **Modify** the content of the page
3. **Program** rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. **React** to events triggered by the user or browser 

- A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

- WRITING A SCRIPT
-To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

1.  DEFINE THE GOAL 
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3. CODE EACH STEP 
 
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

### EXPRESSIONS ###
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
`var color = 'beige'; `
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 
`var area = 3 * 2;`

### OPERATORS ###
- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 

     - ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : `=`
     - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS : ` -,+,/,* , ++,--,%`
     - STRING OPERATORS :  `greeting= 'Hi ' + 'Mol ly';` 
     - COMPARISON OPERATORS : `>,<,!=`
     - LOGICAL OPERATORS : `&&, ||,!==`
