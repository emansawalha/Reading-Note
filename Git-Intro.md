* ## Version control  :
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS),
mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

* ## Local Version Control:
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

* ## Centralized Version Control:
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.its  allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities 
with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

* ## Distributed Version Control:
  * A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure.
  * To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily 
  be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
  *Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various 
  ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.
  
 * ## what is Git? 
   * **Snapshots** :Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
   * **Local Operations** :Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.
   * **Tracking Changes** :Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
   * **Loss of Data** : Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
   * **States** : Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
