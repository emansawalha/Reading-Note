##  Introducing CSS ##
- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

- types of selectors:
   
   Selector |	Description
   ---------|--------------
   element	|Type ** selector. ** Matches an element.
   .class	|Class selector. Matches the value of a class attribute.
   #id      |	ID selector. Matches the value of an id attribute.
  ` *	`    |Universal selector. Matches everything.
    
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. 

          - For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

 -  CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## COLORS ##
 
 - Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

-  There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

     - RGB values: RGB color space or RGB color system, constructs all the colors from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue colors.

     -  hex codes:Color-hex gives information about colors including color models (RGB,HSL,HSV and CMYK), Triadic colors, monochromatic colors and analogous colors calculated in color page.
     [see this site ](https://www.color-hex.com/)

     -  color names:All modern browsers support the following 140 color names [see this website](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)

-  Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

-  CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

-  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
