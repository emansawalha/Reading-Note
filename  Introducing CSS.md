##  Introducing CSS ##
- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

- types of selectors:
   
   Selector |	Description
   ---------|--------------
   element	|Type ** selector. ** Matches an element.
   .class	|Class selector. Matches the value of a class attribute.
   #id      |	ID selector. Matches the value of an id attribute.
  ` *	`    |Universal selector. Matches everything.
    
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. 

          - For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

 -  CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
