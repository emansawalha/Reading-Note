# TEXT #
- When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

- **Structural markup** : the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.




**Tag name**| **Description**
------------|----------------
 `<h1> to <h6>`|It defines headings for an HTML document from level 1 to level 6.
 `<p>` | It represents a paragraph in an HTML document.
 `<b>` | It is used to make a text **bold**.
 `<i>` |It is used to make a text *italic*.
 `<sub>`|It defines a text which displays as a subscript text.
 `<sup>`|It defines a text which represent as superscript text.
 `<br />` |It is used to apply single line break.
 `<hr />`|It is used to apply tadd a horizontal rule between sections.


- **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.

**Tag name**| **Description**
------------|----------------
 `<strong>`|	It is used to define important text.
 `<em>`    |It is used to emphasis the content applied within      this                 element.
 `<blockquote>`| It is used to define a content which is taken from another source.
 `<q>` | It defines short inline quotation.
 `<abbr>`| It defines an abbreviation for a phrase or longer word.
 `<cite>`|It is used to define the title of the work, book, website, etc.
 `<dfn>`| It is used to indicate a term which is defined within a sentence/phrase.
 `<address>`|It defines the author's contact information of the HTML article.
 `<ins>`| It represent text that has been inserted within an HTML document.
 `<del`|It defines a text which has been deleted from the document.
 `<s>` | It render text which is no longer correct or relevant.



- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Introducing CSS #
- A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

![css](/home/emansawalha/Reading-Note/Capture.PNG)

- **Using External CSS**
 Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the `<link>` element, inside the head section.
  - ` href ` :This specifies the path to the CSS file
  - `type`: This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to.
  - `rel` :This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.

- **Using Internal CSS**
  - An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

 - The internal style is defined inside the `<style>` element, inside the head section.

 - **Inline CSS**
   - An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

   - To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
-  Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions #

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.

- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
