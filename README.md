# Growth Mindset

## What is a growth mindset?
 it is the belief that a person's capacities and talents can be improved over time, and its contrast with **fixed mindset** -the limiting belief that such capacities cannot be meaningfully developed. individuals with a growth mindset will be more oriented toward self-improvement and more likely to persist in the face of challenges and failures because they will treat them as opportunities to grow rather than signs that their abilities are inadequate.

## Key Differences Between “Fixed” and “Growth” Mindset:
&nbsp;
1. **Challenges** :A “fixed mindset” person shies away from challenges, possibly from fear of failure and may go into hiding as a way to avoid responsibilities. In contrast, the “growth mindset” person finds challenges to be exciting and engaging, knowing that they will learn something valuable from their experiences.

&nbsp;
2. **Obstacles** :  A “fixed mindset” person lose focus and doing anything to delay keeping at it and fighting through the discomfort. A coworker calls this “instant gratification monkey syndrome.”In contrast, the “growth mindset” person avoiding and losing focus, “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done.

3. **Effort** : “fixed mindset” person may recruit others to do the hardest parts, spending as little effort as possible, while the “growth mindset” person believes that good outcomes often require exertion—“effort” is just a part of the process. 

4. **Criticism** : A"fixed mindset" is that they take criticism personally and think of it as a roadblock. They don’t see it as someone trying to help them out by pointing out their weaknesses.In other hand the "growth mindset" must be  open to receiving criticism positively and not think of it as an insult or indicator of failure. 

5. ** Success of others**:People with a growth mindset don’t just reward their traits, but they reward their actions. Even those actions which failed should be rewarded for the sake of trying. If someone is good at something, it is acceptable that their talent is appreciated. If you aren’t good at it, but still try to hone your skills and learn, that too should be equally appreciated and rewarded. Make it a habit to reward yourself so that you don’t lose the motivation to continue and keep the process of learning as ongoing.

Lastly, Your mind and the way it is set determines your way of life. A belief that you are capable of growth is always preferable as it provides more opportunities for development. Allow yourself to grow even with the growing pains, it will be worth it in the end.:heart:
