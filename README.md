# Growth Mindset

## What is a growth mindset?
 it is the belief that a person's capacities and talents can be improved over time, and its contrast with **fixed mindset** -the limiting belief that such capacities cannot be meaningfully developed. individuals with a growth mindset will be more oriented toward self-improvement and more likely to persist in the face of challenges and failures because they will treat them as opportunities to grow rather than signs that their abilities are inadequate.
